- Create new folder "JTO", fork the project in Github and clone it 
- Create new python enviroment : "python -m venv env" ( for python 3 and above, virtualenv will be installed) (http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/installation/)
- Active the enviroment : got to "env/Scripts/" and run "activate.bat" or when start debugging using vso), then install Flask : "pip install Flask". 
- pip install -r requirements.txt (install all needed packages)
- Intall Postgresql version 10.9 (https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads) 
- To login to the superuser : psql -U postgres and the password you entered in the installation
- create database JTO using psql command line or from pgadmin 
- Run the following to prepare the database : 
    - "python manage.py db init" (one time only) # creates the migration folder
    - "python manage.py db migrate"
        - Choose one of the both options : 
            - "python manage.py db upgrade --sql > migration.sql" # update the "migration.sql" file with the sql script. Then run manually on the db
            - "python manage.py db upgrade" # update the db automaticaly


in case of this error when migrate : " Target database is not up to date."

python manage.py db stamp head
python manage.py db migrate
python manage.py db upgrade

====STEPS TO FIX ERRORS WITH MIGRATIONS FOLDER===

1- "drop table alembic_version" from the database
2- delete migrations folder
3- python manage.py db init
4- python manage.py db migrate
5- python manage.py db upgrade

==> I removed the migrations folder from the repo, so I guess (hopefully), it will
solve the problems we are facing today.
